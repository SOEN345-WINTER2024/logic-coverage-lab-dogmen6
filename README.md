## Content:

CheckIt.java: contains the modified code of the CheckIt method to make tests pass

CheckItTest.java: contains all tests for Predicate Coverage, Clause Coverage, CACC and RACC

## Definitions:

**Predicate Coverage:** Test cases cover at least one true condition and one false condition

**Clause Coverage:** There are tests for all true conditions for each individual clause and one test for all false conditions.

**CACC (Conditional-Absolute Clause Coverage):** All possible combinations of true/false values for the clauses are covered in separate tests, ensuring each combination is tested at least once.

**RACC (Restricted-Absolute Clause Coverage):** Similar to CACC, all possible combinations of true/false values for the clauses are covered, including those where a clause's value doesn't affect the outcome.
